## Hello, World!

Over the years, I've worked at a wide range of technical levels, from the raw asssembly neeeded for operating systems and language toolchains, up to phone and watch delivered end-user applications.

Although I'm most at home on the back end, I'm willing to wear other hats briefly, including less-technical work such as marcom and sales support.

Most recently I was selected for a programmers' retreat at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), where as a member of the Fall 1 batch, I:
- Researched and wrote a lo-dep [Bézier Boolean Operations](https://github.com/demaere-oiie/fantastic-parakeet) package
- Wrangled LLMs into [agentic code generation](https://github.com/demaere-oiie/stunning-robot) with the aid of [DSPy](https://dspy.ai)
- Gave a series of [presentations](https://davelongpresentations.rcdis.co) to batch mates and the wider community

Other work here includes:
- Font rendering contributions to the [Plush](https://github.com/demaere-oiie/plush/tree/main) language
- [Beltabol](https://github.com/demaere-oiie/beltabol), a programming fan-lang based on The Expanse universe
- Just-In-Time [machine code generation](https://github.com/demaere-oiie/200andchange/blob/main/just-in-time/index.py) contributed to the "[200 and change](https://pdubroy.github.io/200andchange/)" project
